## Testing the Gas Station

This app will:
1. Build a SUI transfer transaction
2. Send it to your gas station API for sponsorship
3. Receive the sponsored transaction back
4. Allow you to sign and execute it with your wallet

The gas fees will be paid by the gas station, not your wallet!

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure your gas station is running
- Ensure you have SUI testnet tokens in your wallet
- Check the browser console for detailed error messages
